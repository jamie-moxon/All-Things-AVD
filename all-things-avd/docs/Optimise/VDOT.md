# Virtual Desktop Optimisation Tool

The Virtual Desktop Optimization Tool (VDOT) is a set of mostly text-based tools that apply settings to a Windows operating system, intended to improve performance. The performance gains are in overall startup time, first logon time, subsequent logon time, and usability during a user-session.
