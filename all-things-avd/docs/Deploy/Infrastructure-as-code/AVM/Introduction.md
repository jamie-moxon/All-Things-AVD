# What Are Azure Verified Modules?

Azure Verified Modules (AVM) is an initiative to consolidate and set the standards for what a good Infrastructure-as-Code module looks like.

Modules will then align to these standards, across languages (Bicep, Terraform etc.) and will then be classified as AVMs and available from their respective language specific registries.

AVM is a common code base, a toolkit for Microsoft Customers, Partners, and Microsoft themselves!. Itâ€™s an official, Microsoft driven initiative, with a devolved ownership approach to develop modules, leveraging internal & external communities.

Azure Verified Modules enable and accelerate consistent solution development and delivery of cloud-native or migrated applications and their supporting infrastructure by codifying Microsoft guidance (WAF), with best practice configurations.
