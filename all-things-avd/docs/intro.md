# All Things Azure Virtual Desktop

Welcome to All Things AVD, a community led site to help you deploy, manage and optimise Azure Virtual Desktop for your organisation or your clients.

## What is All Things AVD?

All things AVD was created for IT Pros and Cloud Engineers to have a centralised source of information, guides, tips and tricks for deploying, Managing and optimising Azure Virtual Desktop.

What we aren't over here is a replacement for Microsoft Learn Docs. That is a great place to learn the theory and technology behind Azure Virtual Desktop. What we provide are excellent guides and tools from out there in the Microsoft and technology communities.

## Why did I launch All Things AVD?

As a cloud Engineer deploying Azure Virtual Desktop for clients, I have found it difficult finding a central repository for anything Azure Virtual Desktop. There are lots of great sources of information out there, but nothing has been centralised, until All Things AVD!

I hope you find All Things AVD easy to use and navigate through the list of tips, tricks and tools you can use in your environment. 

Thank you

Jamie
