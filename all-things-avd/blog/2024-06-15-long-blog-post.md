Welcome to All Things AVD!

Thank you for visiting and exploring our platform. A lot of effort has gone into creating All Things AVD, along with the guides and tools we've made available.

<!-- truncate -->

I launched this website to assist fellow IT professionals and engineers in deploying a successful Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) environment. My goal is to help you and your clients use AVD in an optimized and cost-efficient manner.

During my own AVD deployments, I've discovered many valuable resourcesâ€”whether through GitHub, Microsoft Documentation, or various blogs and websites. However, I found no single platform that brings all these tools together in one searchable resource. That's where All Things AVD comes in.

All Things AVD aims to be a centralized repository for all the useful tools, tips, and guides for deploying, securing, and operating an Azure Virtual Desktop environment. Our platform is built on Docusaurus, an excellent tool for documentation-based websites like this one. Additionally, we utilize Azure Static Web Apps, a fantastic solution for deploying static websites.

Currently, I am the sole person keeping the content up-to-date and fresh, so please keep that in mind as you navigate the site. Once again, thank you for visiting All Things AVD. I hope you enjoy your experience, and I look forward to seeing you around!

Best regards,
Jamie
